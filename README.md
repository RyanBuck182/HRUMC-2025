# HRUMC 2025

The [Hudson River Undergraduate Mathematics Conference](https://sites.google.com/view/hrumc) has a fairly self-explanatory name. Basically, a bunch of undergraduates go to a conference and give presentations to eachother.

I plan to give a talk on the **minimax** algorithm this year, so I wrote some code to visualize it! I was originally gonna do this manually with an online graphviz editor, but that was too much effort so I wrote this.

It doesn't actually implement the minimax algorithm, not cause it can't or wouldn't work but because it's almost 4am at the time of writing this and it works perfectly fine hardcoded.

## How To Run

No python packages are necessary, however you do need to have [graphviz](https://graphviz.org/download/) installed with the `Graphviz\bin` folder added to the PATH environment variable (which it will do automatically if you choose the right option in the Windows installer, if you're on Linux I'm sure you can figure it out yourself).

Awesome have fun!
